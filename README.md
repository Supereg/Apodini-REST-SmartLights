# Apodini REST SmartLights

This project serves as a example for building a REST API with support for
_Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State_ (HATEOAS),
built with [Apodini](https://github.com/Apodini/Apodini) - A declarative, composable server-side Swift framework.

For more information on HATEOAS you might want to checkout
